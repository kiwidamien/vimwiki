## Japan

I also have a list of places and links on [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sne6C2kIv4xzj1LwclPHQgSo8oAnQCxYyYW12PXXOWg/edit#gid=1812867853) which I have copied onto this list as well

If feeling lazy, here is a [10 day itinerary](https://theportablewife.com/travel/destinations/10-day-japan-itinerary/). I quite like this blog, as they highlight the less frequently visited (aka off the beaten path) locations, and many of them are quite photogenic. Will indicate with a * places that are on this list.

This is a pretty good overview on [timing](https://www.planetware.com/japan/best-time-to-visit-japan-jpn-1-16.htm#season)

1. Kyoto has the famous [bamboo forest](https://expertphotography.com/pictures-of-japan-travel-photography/)
   1. The streets also have a traditional wooden village feel
   2. Multiple shrines, good for Cherry Blossoms
   3. Amazing in Autumn, in particular the [Kiyomizudera shrine -- num 3 on this list](https://www.thewanderinglens.com/autumn-japan-landscape-photography-tips/)
2. The bathing monkeys
   1. Yamanouchi Monkey Park
   2. Also in Jigokudani park in Nagano Province. I think this is the same place as number 1. This is about 3.5 hours drive/7 hours by transit from Toyko. Around 250 kms.
   3. Are there other locations?
3. FushimiInari Shrine (the orange pillars)
4. Osaka Castle
5. [Gokayama](https://www.hotels.com/go/japan/best-photo-destinations-japan), good in winter. Isolated village in the hills, with thatchy roofs. Also see [here](https://www.planetware.com/pictures/japan-jpn.htm)
6. Fishing Village
7. [Shirikawa](https://www.planetware.com/pictures/japan-jpn.htm), number #3 on that list
8. Narai-juku (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DigfE2oMj0g))
9. [Shimoda](https://passionpassport.com/village-life-japan/)
10. [Fujikawaguchiko](https://passionpassport.com/village-life-japan/)
11. [Izu Pennisula](https://theportablewife.com/travel/destinations/japan-off-the-beaten-path/) has a really nice view of Fuji fomr a rural area over sea + cliffs. Also note the waterfall trail.
12. [Matsumoto Castle](https://theportablewife.com/travel/destinations/japan-off-the-beaten-path/) in Matsumoto. Also see Nakamachi Street for black and white store houses. In the same prefecture -- Nagano -- as the snow monkeys.
13. [Matsuyama](https://theportablewife.com/travel/destinations/japan-off-the-beaten-path/) is a little hard to get to. It seems to be on Shikoku Island. Has the oldest hot spring (Dogo Onsen) which is said to have inspired the onsen in Spirited Away. The building around town appear to be traditional and wooden; the castle is located in the middle of town and is supposed to be quite impressive. The blog post only shows a picture of a woorden meeting hall/onsen, but it stands out.
14. The fishing village of [Ine Funaya](https://theportablewife.com/travel/destinations/japan-off-the-beaten-path/), which can be reached if going  to Kyoto.
15. Rice Terraces in [Maruyama Senmaida Terraces](https://www.tsunagujapan.com/16-unique-places-in-japan-that-are-not-widely-known-but-are-absolutely-mesmerising/) in Mie prefecture
16. [Nachi Falls](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-tokyo/in-tokyo_suburbs/article-a0004395/) waterfall with Shrine in a Forest. In Wakayama Prefecture.
17. Hitachi Seaside Park for flowers and blooms. calendar on [this page](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-ibaraki/in-ibaraki_suburbs/article-a0002214/). Popular in spring, but I am interested in Autumn for the red [kochias bloom](https://thegate12.com/article/140). Takes the color early to mid October.
18. Really liked pictures of [Takayama](https://www.theinvisibletourist.com/japan-off-the-beaten-path-places-less-travelled/) here
19. Zao Fox Village has over 100 foxes wandering around from 6 species, has it in [here](https://www.adequatetravel.com/blog/weird-places-in-japan-that-exists/) from the Kitsune Mira
20. [Koishikawa Korakuen Garden](https://japanobjects.com/features/tokyo-gardens) for Red Colors in Fall
21. [Maybe -- Kyushu](https://bucketlistseekers.com/off-the-beaten-path-japan-hidden-gems/)
22. [Oishi Park](https://aniolvisuals.com/japan-best-photography-spots/) for flowers over Fuji. Best in Spring and Fall.
23. [This site has some good locations for photos in Kyoto](https://aniolvisuals.com/japan-best-photography-spots/). The Koyasu Pagoda seems especially nice! The bottom of the article has places broken down by area, which is really useful. I really liked the areas in Kyoto, and the Kii Penisula.
24. [Kiyotsu Gorge Tunnel](https://www.planetware.com/pictures/japan-jpn.htm) number #19, especially in Fall. 
25. 
## Honolulu / Oahu

## Utah / Southeast
