# Finding Jupyter kernels

In the shell, you can find a list of running jupyter servers via
```bash
$ jupyter lab list
```
This will give you a URL and port that you can use to access the Jupyter lab session

# Stopping a Jupyter server

1. Using the previous command, you can find the port
2. You can then run, in bash, `jupyter lab stop <PORT NUMBER>`
