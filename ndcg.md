# Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain

 Goal:
 Score a ranking of a list, in such a way that we penalize the ranking for putting good results low down the list.
 
 What is needed:
 A source of truth for what an "ideal search engine" should return. I have a lot of questions about how this is obtained, and if/how we discount the true results in the context of an e-commerce search.
