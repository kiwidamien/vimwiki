# Testing a "For You" page

[Project management spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YcgdLRHoQmrgdsd3JEGh98_FPCk8h75_RZx8KnKR9ac/edit#gid=259098812)

Looking at creating a personalized discovery surface to do a "For You" page.
Similar to the MyBrands page, which includes brands that you follow, brands you have ordered from etc.

We are looking at a potential alternative to the homepage here.

The ask is to estimate the work that would need to be done to launch a test here.

Questions:
- What features do we have in the current rankers that make it not "For You"?
- What can we add that makes it closer to a "For You" page
- How do we differentiate from a MyBrands experience? The clearest way is that we should be also ranking brands that are not in the set of brands you have ordered from or brands you follow.
