In a different vein, some resources for high cardinality time-series. Specifically looking at making time series predictions for multiple skus.
[Here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/389291/strategies-for-time-series-forecasting-for-2000-different-products) is the stack overflow answer. Recommendations were:
- Try a hierarical approach
- Try a neural net (i.e. throw everything, see what sticks approach)
- Try something called [optimal reconsiliation](https://otexts.com/fpp2/reconciliation.html) (external notes)
