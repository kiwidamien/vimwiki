# 2023 Finances


* StitchFix 2023 401k contribution: 8491.53 (from myadp.com

* Faire has two pay periods a month, so the amounts will fluctuate. I will have 9 months, so 18 paychecks from Faire.
   * This is different from StitchFix, which paid us every two weeks
* We know that I have 22,500 to contribute, so (22500-8491)=14_009 left to contribute
* This means that I expect to contribute, on average, $14_009/18=778 (rounded down) per paycheck
