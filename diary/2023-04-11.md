## Meeting when Wenhao

Big takeaway is that we are seeing massive differences in retailers buying brands, specifically they want to buy local.
When looking, there are four different categories: same country, same region, same continent, global
We can compare impressions (basically what we serve) with add-to-cart and compare them. At the moment, our NA brands are overrepresented in search, because our training sets and retailers dominate our calcuation of the metrics.
