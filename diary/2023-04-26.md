# Cold start hub meeting notes

Yena sharing retailer interview notes.
- Jennifer has a store called Pie Bird Farm (`r_cx8wbfwp3j`)
- Jennifer would like to see things on Faire that she can't find anywhere else, not being mass produced
- She really like a ceramics brand that she found on Etsy.
- General themes
   - Dissapointed because it's become so much harder to find quality of products. Much bigger spread than there used to be.  Reminds her of the way Etsy has gotten
      - Does not consider a painting on a mass produced plate as handmade.
      - Made in USA items seem to be coming from China (or at least from mass produced -- non-US might be an assumption)
   - From Jessica at Faire: this notion of items that are handmade and quality of goods going down is a common complaint amongst smaller retailers
