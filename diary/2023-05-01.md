# Meeting with Max

- What is the value of Day #0 vs Day #1 recommendations?
- We get a kink in conversions at day 7, but this is driven by our incentives for new retailers expiring
- Much smoother in terms of number of visits.

What I am telling Max:
- Most of my cold-start features are helping Europe (integrating geo info), probably minimal effect on NAM
- Jingu's embedding work is probably going to help the most with cold start (and that will be available at ~1 day cadence)
- We talked about the possibility of better taxonomy
  - Damien: look at subclusters in our embedding space
  - Max: look at different outcomes in conversion based on store type
