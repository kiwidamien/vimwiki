Wei Jiang on inspire, vs thematic

Inspire pod is about a year old when Wei Jiang joined; definiton of POD can be changed due to OKR etc.
Thematic supports different themes, like holiday, cards, seasonal, etc

CatNav v15 context
- data issue since Feb, only realized last week
   - offline looked awesome, online was poor
   - use impression / viewport.
   - we are missing impression / viewport data for the first page. Probably only happen on some device, still being evaluated
   - we have seen some weird issues with catnav for the past month
   - it means that we have been training without the first page of results
- There are some features that are
   - expect launch in three to four weeks after catnav ii

### Meeting with Sydney Watts

What does Q2 look like

holiday, new arrivals, best sellers
Can get sales, but probably have higher INCREMENTAL impact on the dimensions above.

Thinking about the strategic implementation. Most likely implemenation is using back-to-school as a tracer bullet to estimate the size of the holiday surface.

End state where we have a merchandised holiday, ahd we are able to predict demand trends.
Can we do something with standardized solution, as well as trend driven experiences.
