## Meeting with Keith

Looking at different data questions / tables

Q: What are the total amounts of revenue/orders that we have made from a particular retailer?
RETAILER_TOKEN   REVENUE   COUNT(BRAND_ORDERS)

Order:  One "cart" that can contain many different brands. Basically think of 

Q: How to find the fraction of orders that originate / are attributed to a particular surface  (probably requires some matching of an orders table with various ranking tables)
ETL_RANKING.ANALYTICS.ETL_RANKING.PRODUCT_IMPRESSION_ATTRIBUTION_1H

Q: 

Q: How many retailers are enrolled in Faire direct at any given time?
Q: Is every product in a single C3? Or can it be in multiple? Or zero?
Q: What are the differences between canonical and production? Which should I be using? e.g. canonical.orders vs production.orders


Overall question:
- How does the quality of our recommendations improve for a retailer over time/orders placed?
   - Can look at the order volume or dollar volume increase over time
   - We have some of this already in the layer cake diagram
   - Can look at number of orders / % of orders that originate with search vs different surfaces (although this would really tell us about differential impact, as search has a recommendation element as well)

Slack search, post question in #discovery-data-team
