## Weekly thematic pod leader meetings

Things have been delayed last couple of weeks, mostly due to OoO.
There are also a lot of audits happening this week.

Most of this week seems to be about why the timeline in this pod has slipped.
Priorities are requiring focus

# Meeting with Max

Q: What does it cost Brands to use Faire? That is, what value do we have to bring to make it worthwhile?

We have 100k brands, about 25% matter in terms of order value.
On brand aquisition side, tradeoff between number and quality.

Commission structure between brands and retailers:
25% commission on first order
15% for subsequent order between retailer and brand, typical is 12-14% 
0% for Faire direct (i.e. preexisting relationship relationship between retailer and brand)

Lots of weirdness around Faire direct, isn't really clear what it means to have a pre-existing relationship
