## Inspire weekly meeting

Sydney Watts - PM for Pod
Dale Shearin - Product and Strategy Analytics
Raissa Nucci - Eng lead
Chris Chappelle - Lead product designer


Two back to back meetings, to align on priorities and what we are doing for the week. There are two meetings: lead for getting themes, and then eng where the themes for the week are separated out to individual ICs.

Experiment recap:
- Empty Cart Recommendations is neutral in results. We moved to an ElasticSearch solutions, which increase latency. The fix was to revert back to a data base solution (not clear what this means -- precomputed searches seems most likely in context). Claim was that other surfaces not using ES were not seeing the same latency.
- Products in Cart Recommendations also neutral. Had trouble figuring out what the actual issue was / could be.

We are moving away from Brand First collections as the theme. Focus is on 
- new
- best-sellers
- holidays
