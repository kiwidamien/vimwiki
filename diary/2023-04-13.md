## Inspire pod

Commitments for Q2, consulting topics
- Ailes, Top Brands are things that we want to keep
- Discovery will own signals
- Scannable Ailses: We are technically consults on this, Jingu is partner DS? No one is signing off on this yet.
   - Wei is DRE
   - For Brands is Tim Liu
   - Emails is ????
Basic issue is that other teams are developing signals that we are going to eventually own.
It isn't clear to me what the burden is / issues of signals that are misaligned with our eventual goal.

"If you are on the hook for the consult every single time, you don't have time to build your own stuff; the team has no vision"
